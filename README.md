## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## GameRules

Open the index.html file to start the game. Every opening of a pair of cards will increase the number of moves by 1. Every 10 moves will reduce 1 number of stars. At the beginning, there are 5 stars. Once all cards match, will show the success message.
